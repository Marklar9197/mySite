	<h1> About </h1>
	<div class ='about-me'>
	<p> I grew up on the North Shore of Long Island with my parents and two siblings. After graduating Purchase College with a journalism degree, I travelled to Israel and got my first exposure to the world of programming. Since June 2014, I took programming classes, worked in a development environment, and went to a coding bootcamp. I'm currently looking for an entry level job in Fullstack Web Development. </p>
